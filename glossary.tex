\item[CLIC] Compact Linear Collider.
\item[CTF3] CLIC Test Facility 3.
\item[BPM] Beam Position Monitor.
\item[PFF] Phase Feedforward.
\item[CT Line] Beam line connecting the linac and TL1 at CTF3.
\item[TL1] Transfer line between the delay loop exit and the combiner ring entrance at CTF3.
\item[TL2] Transfer line between the combiner ring exit and CLEX at CTF3. Contains the PFF correction chicane.
\item[CLEX] CLIC Experimental Area at CTF3.
\item[TBL] Test Beam Line at CTF3 in CLEX. Where the downstream phase monitor is installed.
\item[Upstream Phase] Phase measured by either Mon~1 or Mon~2 in the CT line. Used as the PFF input.
\item[Downstream Phase] Phase measured by Mon~3 in the TBL line, after the correction chicane.
\item[\(\sigma_{u}\)] Upstream phase jitter.
\item[\(\sigma_{d}\)] Downstream phase jitter.
\item[\(\rho_{ud}\)] Correlation between the upstream and downstream phase.
\item[\(\rho_{up}\)] Correlation between the upstream phase and the beam energy.
\item[\(\rho_{dp}\)] Correlation between the downstream phase and the beam energy.
\item[Jitter] Standard deviation.
\item[\(R_{56}\)] First order transfer matrix coefficient describing the dependence of the phase on the beam energy.
\item[\(T_{566}\)] Transfer matrix coefficient describing the second order dependence of the phase on the beam energy.
\item[ADC] Analogue to Digital Converter.
\item[DAC] Digital to Analogue Converter.
\item[DAQ] Data Acquisition system, usually referring to the LabVIEW application used to control the FONT5a board.
\item[FONT5a Board] Digital PFF controller, provided by Oxford University.
