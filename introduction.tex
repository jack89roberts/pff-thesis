\newsection{partPhys}{Particle Physics}

Particle physics is the study of the building blocks of the universe. At its heart is the standard model, which defines a small number of fundamental particles, spin half fermions, that form the constituents of all visible matter in the universe, as well integer spin bosons that mediate the forces between the fermions. Tables~\ref{t:fermions}~and~\ref{t:bosons} list all the standard model fermions and bosons, respectively. 

The fermions are split in to two types -- leptons with an integer charge of -1 (charged leptons) or 0 (neutrinos), and quarks with fractional charges of +2/3 or -1/3. The fermions are also split in to three generations, each with a charged lepton, neutrino, positively charged quark and negatively charged quark. The mass of the particles increases with the generation, and all stable matter is comprimsed of the first generation particles. Every particle in the standard model has an associated anti-particle, with the same mass but opposite charge. 

The fermions in the standard model interact via three fundamental forces -- the electromagnetic force, mediated by the photon, the weak force, mediated by the W and Z bosons, and the strong force, mediated by the gluon. The strong force binds quarks together to form hadrons, which are either a quark---anti-quark pair (mesons), or a bound state of three quarks (hadrons). Protons are hadrons comprising of two up quarks and one down quark. Quarks also interact via the electromagnetic and weak forces. Leptons do not interact with the strong force -- neutrinos only interact via the weak force, and the charged leptons interact via the weak and electromagnetic forces. The final component of the standard model is the Higgs field,  which is responsible for giving particles their masses, and its associated Higgs boson [REF].

The standard model has been the subject of extensive theoretical and experimental research over the last 50 years. This culminated in 2012 with the discovery of the final standard model particle yet to be observed experimentally, the Higgs Boson, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), CERN, Switzerland [REF]. Despite the incredible success of the standard model there are several known phenomena it cannot explain. For example, it does not include the gravitational force nor have viable particles or mechanisms to describe dark matter and dark energy, which are required to explain observations in cosmology such as the increasing rate of expansion of the universe [REF]. The LHC and other experiments around the world aim to discover new particles or find discrepancies in the standard model to explain these effects.

\newsection{ctfIntro}{The CLIC Test Facility CTF3}

The CLIC design requires the use of many new concepts and technologies. Therefore, to prove the feasibility of CLIC the test facility CTF3 at CERN has been in operation since 2001. It aims to demonstrate the generation of a high intensity drive beam using the bunch recombination process, as well as the extraction of power from this drive beam and the use of the extracted power to accelerate another beam. CTF3 also hosts many related activities in areas such as the development of 12~GHz accelerating cavities and beam instrumentation, for example [REF]. The main goals of CTF3 have been achieved and 2016 will be its last year of operation [REF].

A diagram of the CTF3 facility is found in Figure~\ref{f:ctfLayout},  showing the layout of buildings (purple) and beam lines (red) with the names and extent of the main sections labelled in black. The source of the CTF3 beam, at the top left of the figure in the linac, is a thermionic electron gun [REF] that produces a \(1.4~\mathrm{\mu s}\) beam pulse with an intensity of 4~A and a repetition rate of 0.8~Hz. The first 200~ns of the pulse contains a sharp energy transient and is eventually lost in the first bending sections of the facility, creating a usable pulse length of around \(1.2~\mathrm{\mu s}\). The continous beam pulse from the gun is bunched at either 1.5~GHz or 3~GHz depending on the mode of operation [REF].

\afterpage{\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{Figures/introduction/ctfLayout}
  \caption{Layout of CTF3 with the main sections labelled.}
  \label{f:ctfLayout}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}}

The beam is accelerated along the linac in 3~GHz RF cavities powered by conventional klystrons combined with RF pulse compressors which double their output power [REF]. The accelerating cavities are operated in the fully loaded mode, in which almost all the RF power sent to the cavity is absorbed by the beam for high power efficiency [REF]. At the end of the linac the beam reaches an energy of approximately 135~MeV.

Following the linac the beam intensity can be increased by up to a factor 8 using the delay loop and combiner ring, which both function in the same way as described for CLIC in Section~\ref{s:clicIntro}. Experiments at CTF3 are usually performed with either a 3~GHz factor 1 (4~A) or factor 4 (16~A) beam, or a 1.5~GHz factor 8 (28~A) beam. For the setups with 3~GHz bunching the delay loop is bypassed. The number of times the beam circulates around the combiner ring can be varied between 0.5 and 3.5 turns to give an increase in beam intensity by a factor 1, 2, 3 or 4. With 1.5~GHz beam a 1.5~GHz RF deflector [REF] is used at the delay loop entrance to inject alternating 140~ns sub-trains in to the loop. The sub-trains exiting the loop merge with the 140~ns trains bypassing the loop to give a factor 2 increase in beam intensity. The intensity of this factor 2 beam can then also be increased by additional factor 4 in the combiner ring, to give the total increase of a factor 8.

Following the combiner ring the beam enters the transfer line TL2, which transports the beam to the CLIC experimental area (CLEX). In CLEX the CTF3 drive beam can be directed to two different beam lines - TBL (Test Beam Line) and TBM (Two Beam Module). In TBL a series of PETS are installed to test the extraction of power from the drive beam and to measure the properties of the produced RF power [REF]. In TBM a prototype CLIC accelerating module is installed, in which RF power is extracted from the drive beam and used to accelerate a second beam, called CALIFES. The CALIFES beam also hosts many experiments independent from the CTF3 drive beam [REF].

\newsection{pffCTFIntro}{The PFF Prototype at CTF3}

The phase feedforward system proposed for CLIC (Section~\ref{s:}) presents many challenges in terms of the required hardware latencies, resolutions, power and bandwidth. As a result, one of the key activities at CTF3 since 2013 has been the design, installation and operation of a prototype PFF system. The primary goal of the PFF prototype is to demonstrate the feasibility of the PFF concept, with the ultimate aim of reducing the CTF3 phase jitter to close to the CLIC requirement of \(0.2^\circ\)~at~12~GHz, with a correction bandwidth above 17.5~MHz. The pursuit of this goal has required the development and installation of new hardware, as well as modifications and improvements to the setup and stability of the whole CTF3 drive beam complex.

The layout of the PFF prototype is shown in Figure~\ref{f:ctfpffLayout}. The overall concept is the same as the CLIC proposal -- the beam phase is measured prior to a turnaround and then corrected by changing the path length through a chicane using kickers. At CTF3 the PFF input is the phase measured in the CT line (\(\phi_1\) in the figure). The phase is then corrected using two kickers installed in the ``dog-leg'' shaped chicane in the TL2 transfer line.  A 3~GHz, uncombined beam is used, bypassing the delay loop (DL) and completing only half a turn in the combiner ring (CR). With this setup the time of flight between the phase monitor (\(\phi_1\)) and the first kicker (K1) is approximately 380~ns. Like the proposed CLIC system, the PFF prototype aims to apply the correction downstream (in TL2) to exactly the same pulse that was initially measured upstream (in the CT line), which is possible as the correction signals travel a shorter distance than the beam. The latency of the whole system, including the signal transit times in cables and hardware latencies, must therefore be less than 380~ns.

The black box ``PFF'' represents the calculation and output of the correction, including the phase monitor electronics, feedforward controller and kicker amplifiers. A bunch arriving early at \(\phi_1\) is directed on to a longer path in the TL2 chicane using the kickers (blue trajectory), whereas a bunch arriving late will be directed on to a shorter  path (red trajectory)}.

\end{figure}
\end{landscape}}

\subsection{Hardware}
\label{ss:ctfPFFHardware}

The major hardware components of the PFF prototype are three phase monitors, two kickers, three sets of electronics for the phase monitors, a digitiser/feedforward controller and amplifiers to power the kickers (referred to as the kicker amplifiers). All the hardware components were designed, built and newly installed at CTF3 for the PFF prototype. The same components could be used at CLIC, with some important differences as described in Section~\ref{ss:ctfVsCLIC}. Each piece of hardware and its role is briefly introduced here, with more detail provided for each component in the remainder of the thesis.

The kickers and phase monitors are installed in the beam line at the locations shown in Figure~\ref{f:ctfpffLayout}, whereas the phase monitor electronics, feedforward controller and kicker amplifiers are installed in the CTF3 ``klystron gallery'', on the floor above the accelerator hall, for easier access. The cable lengths between the phase monitors and their electronics, and between the amplifiers and the kickers, are therefore longer than they appear in Figure~\ref{f:ctfpffLayout}.

As already described, the first phase monitor (\(\phi_1\)), in the CT line, provides the PFF input. The neighbouring second phase monitor (\(\phi_2\)), also in the CT line, is used to cross-check and verify the performance of the phase monitors. The final phase monitor (\(\phi_3\)), in the TBL line, measures the corrected phase jitter following the chicane in TL2. The phase monitors are designed by INFN, Italy [REF] to give a resolution below \(0.2^\circ\) at 12~GHz with a bandwidth above 30MHz, also taking in to account the  design of the phase monitor electronics [REF].

The processed signals from the first phase monitor are sent to the ``FONT5a board'', the feedforward controller designed and built by the Oxford University group of the John Adams Institute (JAI) [REF]. With a low latency of around 60~ns [REF], the FONT5a board digitises the phase monitor signals, calculates the appropriate correction to apply and provides the drive signal for the kicker amplifiers.

The kicker amplifiers have also been designed and built by Oxford University/JAI, and provide the voltage that produces the electric and magnetic fields that deflect the beam when applied to the kickers. Each amplifier module provides a power of around 20~kW with a bandwidth close to 50~MHz for small variations [REF]. 

Finally, the two kickers that provide the correction were designed and built by INFN, Italy. The are installed prior to the first and last dipoles in the TL2 dog-leg chicane, and deflect the CTF3 beam through an angle of 1~mrad for an applied voltage of around 1.3~kV [REF].


\subsection{Differences Between PFF at CTF3 and CLIC}
\label{ss:ctfVsCLIC}

The goal of the prototype is to prove the general PFF concept and the feasibility of using it to achieve \(0.2^\circ\) drive beam phase stability. It is neither necessary nor possible for the proposed CLIC and CTF3 systems to be identical, and there are a number of differences between the two that are summarised here. 

The most obvious difference between the applications at CTF3 and CLIC are the different beam energies and scale of the two complexes. CLIC will have a drive beam energy of 2.4~GeV, compared to the 135~MeV CTF3 drive beam. The CLIC PFF system therefore requires much higher power from the kicker amplifiers to deflect the beam by the same amount as the CTF3 prototype. CLIC requires up to 500~kW peak power from the amplifiers, compared to 20~kW at CTF3. Multiple amplifier modules with similar design to the CTF3 amplifiers could be combined to meet the CLIC power requirements [REF].

The CLIC proposal requires 48 separate PFF systems, with one in each of the 24 decelerator sections for each of the two drive beams. Aside from the vast difference in the quantity of required hardware components, the CLIC application also presents the challenge of synchronising the reference timing of the 48 systems along the 50~km facility with femtosecond stability. This is not adressed in the CTF3 prototype but feasible solutions have been proposed [REF].

Although both the CTF3 and CLIC schemes use chicanes to vary the beam trajectory the design of the chicanes used are different -- with a four bend C--shaped chicane with sixteen PFF kickers proposed in the CLIC CDR, compared to the four bend dog leg chicane at CTF3 with two PFF kickers installed for the correction. The freedom to design a purpose built chicane with additional kickers in the CLIC design somewhat simplifies the challenges of obtaining a suitable layout for the prototype chicane at CTF3 using pre-existing beam lines (Chapter~\ref{c:tl2Optics}).

Another key difference is that at CTF3 the PFF prototype is operated on uncombined beam, bypassing the delay loop and completing only half a turn in the combiner ring. At CLIC the complete PFF system (including the PFF input) is placed after the drive beam recombination, and therefore would operate on combined beam. At CTF3 as the PFF input is placed prior to the delay loop any attempt to operate the PFF prototype with combined beam would be complicated by having to use the measured uncombined beam pulse to correct the combined pulse following the combiner ring. Nevertheless, operation of the prototype with combined beam could be possible and may be attempted in future tests.

The main effect of using the uncombined pulse at CTF3 rather than the combined pulse as forseen for CLIC is that the beam pulse lengths are different. At CLIC \(0.2^\circ\) phase stability is needed across the 240~ns combined beam pulse. At CTF3 the uncombined pulse is much longer, up to 1.2~\(\mathrm{\mu s}\). It is therefore not necessary to demonstrate \(0.2^\circ\) phase stability across the full CTF3 pulse length to fulfill the CLIC requirements.

In fact, it is in any case impossible to demonstrate \(0.2^\circ\) phase stability across the full CTF3 pulse length with the PFF prototype due to the large phase sag that is present along the beam pulse. The RF pulse compression system at CTF3 [REF] results in an approximately parabolic variation of roughly \(40^\circ\) along the pulse which would not be present at CLIC. The phase sag is much larger than the correction range of the PFF prototype, which is designed to remove smaller, fast offsets. The PFF correction is therefore focused on the flatter, central part of the pulse around the minimum in the phase sag, where the phase variations across the pulse length relevant for CLIC are within the correction range. This is shown in Figure~\ref{f:ctfPhaseSag}.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/introduction/phaseSag}
  \caption{Phase sag along the 1.2~\(\mathrm{\mu s}\) CTF3 beam pulse. The dashed black lines mark show the 240~ns combined CLIC pulse length centred around the region where the phase sag is flattest.}.
  \label{f:ctfPhaseSag}
\end{figure}

\newsection{phaseJitDefs}{Definitions of Different Phase Statistics}

Throughout the thesis several terms will be use to describe different ways of measuring the phase, as well as other parameters. These terms are briefly summarised here for reference. All quoted phase values throughout the thesis are in degrees at 12~GHz.

CTF3 provides an uncombined beam pulse length of up to 1.2~\(\mathrm{\mu s}\). It is useful to compare results both along the pulse and for the mean of the pulse. To calculate ``mean'' statistics, the average of each beam pulse is taken. Usually this is not taken across the full pulse length, but rather across a a region of several hundred nanoseconds near the mid-portion of the pulse where the beam is most stable and the phase sag is flattest. Mean statistics are usually plotted against time in units of the pulse number, with CTF3 operating at a repetition rate of 0.8~Hz, or one beam pulse every 1.25~s. The mean phase jitter represents the standard deviation of these mean values across the duration of a dataset.

Any statistic instead described as being ``along the pulse'' represents the measured values point by point along the beam pulse, typically sampled at a rate of a few hundred MHz. The time axes for plots of statistics along the pulse are either in units of nanoseconds, or simply the point number along the pulse (sample number). The phase jitter along the pulse represents the standard deviation of the measured phases at each individual sample point taken across the duration of a dataset.

Many of the discussions in the thesis also quote correlation coefficients, which in all cases are Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients [REF].

\newsection{thesisOverview}{Thesis Overview}

This thesis documents the design, commissioning, operation and results of the PFF prototype at CTF3. In Chapter~\ref{c:tl2Optics} the design of the TL2 chicane and the modifications to it that were necessary to achieve the desired phase shifting behaviour are described in more detail. 

The performance of the PFF correction depends on the ability to precisely measure the beam phase, and so Chapter~\ref{c:phaseMons} presents the extensive work that has been completed to understand and maximise the precision of the new purpose built phase monitors that were installed at CTF3 for the PFF system. 

As well as excellent precision in the measured phase, it is crucial to have high correlation between the phase at the end of the linac (the PFF input) and the phase at the correction location (TL2). With no correlation between the phases at these two points no improvement in phase jitter would be possible with the PFF system. Chapter~\ref{c:phasePropagation} describes the process of understanding and improving this correlation.

Chapter~\ref{c:commissioning} focuses on the setup of the remaining PFF hardware components and the commissioning of the complete PFF system. This includes the implementation of the PFF correction on the feedforward controller (the FONT5a board), the design and performance of the kicker amplifiers, as well as verifying the correction timing and correction range.

Chapter~\ref{c:feedforward} then presents the best results that have been achieved with the PFF prototype to date following all the optimisations described in the rest of the thesis. An analysis of the current limitations of the system and possible future improvements to the PFF setup are also discussed. Finally, the conclusions from each chapter and suggestions for future work are summarised in Chapter~\ref{c:conclusion}.
